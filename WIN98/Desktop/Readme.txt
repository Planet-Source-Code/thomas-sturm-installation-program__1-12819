This is a quite small, but yet powerful tool to create Setups for smaller Applications.

It is very easy to use and still able to install nearly any type of application.

It does not write anything to the registry and it does not mess with your system files.

What is does NEED are :

1.) The VB Main Runtime MSVBVM60.DLL

2.) A VB Library called VB6STKIT.DLL

3.) The Scripting Runtime SCRRUN.DLL for the UnInstaller

It shows some advanced Coding techniques under VB and two functions which are quite confusing for someone
who doesn't know how to use them. They are

a) ExtractFileFromCab
b) OSfCreateShellLink

Both are called out of the VB6STKIT.DLL.

And, by the way, this program uses some code from PSC - The InstallBar from Kenneth Gilbert Jr.

Thanks to you for your great Progressbar, this program would have been much more complicated for
me without your code !





NOTE : If you compile the sources into executables, they need to be in the same directory to work properly, 
and DO NOT forget the Makecab.exe, it is required to make the Cab-Files 
(Guess you would know that from the name...) !!!

And sorry that the whole program is in GERMAN, if you need to put it in English, just re-caption the 
corresponding labels according to what you need. If your PC did ever run InstallShield (Guess it did that
before, otherwise you wouldn't have downloaded this code :-), you know how to caption the labels !
